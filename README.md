# Retail Alpha Forecaster

## Executive Summary

Retail Alpha Forecaster is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict daily item-level sales across thousands of retail stores.
The project takes raw Kaggle competition data and builds a **reproducible forecasting pipeline** that mimics what a Data Scientist or
ML Engineer would deploy in a real retail environment.

Key achievements:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered seasonality, store-level trends, and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering:** Built a feature store (lag features, rolling statistics, calendar effects) to support predictive modeling.
- **Modeling & Cross-Validation:** Implemented time-series aware validation, trained gradient boosting models (XGBoost/LightGBM).
- **Backtesting:** Simulated real-world deployment by rolling forward through time, measuring accuracy and stability.
- **Scalability:** Modularized ETL scripts and prepared for BigQuery integration + dashboard deployment (Streamlit).

This repository demonstrates a **full-stack data science workflow**: from raw data → engineered features → ML model →
evaluation → interactive dashboard. It’s both a Kaggle-inspired project and a portfolio-ready
example of production-minded machine learning.
